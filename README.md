## Project - 1: Random Number Guessing Game
### Description: 
This is a number guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.

#### Algorithm:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.

2. Ask the player to choose a difficulty level ('EASY' or 'HARD').
- EASY: Player gets 10 attempts.

- HARD: Player gets 5 attempts.

3. Loop until the player runs out of attempts:

- Prompt the player to guess the number.

- Decrement the number of remaining attempts.
- Check the player's guess:
    - If the guess is correct, print a success message and end the game.
    - If the guess is too high, prompt the player to guess lower.
    - If the guess is too low, prompt the player to guess higher.

4. If the player uses all attempts without guessing correctly, print a failure message.
